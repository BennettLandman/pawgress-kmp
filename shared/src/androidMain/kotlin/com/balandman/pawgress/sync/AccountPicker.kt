/**
 * The system's own Google account chooser.
 *
 * Google's authorization client silently reuses whichever account already
 * granted consent, which is exactly what you want for a background refresh
 * and exactly wrong when someone is trying to switch users. Launching the
 * platform picker first makes the choice explicit — and unlike reading the
 * account list directly, showing this chooser needs no permission at all.
 *
 * Stays Android-only, unlike [AuthProvider] — forcing a specific account
 * choice is already handled differently on each platform (this system
 * chooser vs. Google's own sign-in page doing account selection inline), and
 * its output (an email) just becomes the `accountHint` argument to the
 * shared interface, so no cross-platform abstraction is needed for it.
